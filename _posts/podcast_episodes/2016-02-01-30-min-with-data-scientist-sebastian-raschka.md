In this show I interview Sebastian Raschka, data scientist and author of Python Machine Learning.
In addition to the fun we had offline, there are great elements about machine learning, data science, current and future trends, to keep an ear on. Moreover, it is the conversation of two data scientists who contribute and operate in the field, on a daily basis.

This episode is guaranteed to have great insights.
Enjoy!
