Have you ever thought to get a Big Data infrastructure on your desk? That’s right! On your desk.

In this episode I met Wim Van Leuven ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/wimvanleuven), [LinkedIn](https://be.linkedin.com/in/wimvanleuven)), software guy (and much more), 
who is operating in the data science arena for a while.

He is co-founder of [BigBoards.io](http://www.bigboards.io) and he has one mission: **bringing big data analytics to your desk, in less than 1h.**

Don’t believe it?

Listen to the show!
