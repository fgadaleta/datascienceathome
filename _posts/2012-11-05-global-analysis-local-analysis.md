Local analysis around saddle

When I fell over a paper that claimed global analysis through local
computation around saddle equilibria in bistable systems, I felt like living a
dream (and had to kick a sandwich to realise that I was not). 

Check out [this paper](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0033110
"PlosONE Global analysis through local computation" ) and convince yourself that it is true, under the assumption of hyperbolic systems and non-null eigenvalues.
